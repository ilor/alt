Alternate file cycler for Vim
-----------------------------

a.vim is nice, but somewhat maddening when your path has too much in it. It
also doesn't handle non '.' extensions like Chromium uses.

This one does something crappier that works with Chromium's standard naming
conventions, and doesn't search 'path' (for better or worse). It's also
written in Python because vimscript makes me cry.

To use it:

    cd %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles
    git clone https://github.com/sgraham/alt.git bundle\alt

or:

    cd ~/.vim
    git clone https://github.com/sgraham/alt.git bundle/alt

And add:

    set runtimepath^=~/vimfiles/alt

to your _vimrc.

Then, push Ctrl-Tab to cycle all related files, or Tab to cycle files for the
platform that you're on.
